# Record Store

An app to obtain a text based backup of your Spotify Playlists and Albums

## Running the app locally

Please create a `.env` file in the project root containing the following:

```
CLIENT_ID="<your_client_id>"
PUBLIC_PATH="/"
REDIRECT_URI_BASE="https://127.0.0.1"
```

`<your_client_id>` is found within the settings when you create an app in Spotify Developer tools.
